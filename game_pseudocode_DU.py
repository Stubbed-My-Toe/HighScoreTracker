'''BEGIN Guess the Number Game
# SETUP
    #- The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100 (player tries to guess it)
   # - Create a variable to count how many guesses the player makes
   # - Ask the player for their name (to save their score later)
# GAMEPLAY
  #  - Keep asking the player for a guess until they get it right
   # - After each wrong guess, tell them if their guess was too high or too low
#- Add 1 to the guess count every time they guess
# END OF GAME
   # - When they guess correctly, congratulate them and tell them how many tries it took
   # - Save their name and score (lower tries = better) to a file called "scores.txt"
   #   Format: player_name,number_of_tries
# SAMPLE OUTPUT
  #  Enter your name: Alex
  #  Guess a number between 1 and 100: 50
  #  Too low, try again
  #  Guess a number between 1 and 100: 75
  #  Too high, try again
  #  Guess a number between 1 and 100: 62
  #  Congratulations Alex! You got it in 3 attempts
